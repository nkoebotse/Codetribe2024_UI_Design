React UI Challenge
Welcome to the React UI Challenge! This is your opportunity to showcase your skills by building a visually stunning UI using React. The focus is on components, JSX, and styling—no complex logic needed, just pure UI magic!

What You’ll Need:
Basic understanding of HTML and CSS
Folder for the UI challenge
The Task:
Navigate to the UI folder assigned to you and familiarize yourself with the challenge details.
Pixel perfect is the Goal: Look closely at the challenge details. Your mission is to build a UI that matches the design as closely as possible.

Tips for Success:
Break it down: Divide the UI into smaller components (buttons, forms, charts, etc.) and tackle them one by one.

Think in JSX: Use JSX to write your React components, combining HTML-like structures with JavaScript power.

Style it right: Apply CSS to make your UI amazing.
